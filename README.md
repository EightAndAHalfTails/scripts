Scripts
=======

Various scripts. Basically a copy of my ~/bin directory. Some may be useful, some are simply one-use scripts I wrote to solve a specific problem, and some are just for fun.


Useful
======

- mkv2gif.py        ---converts a specified clip from an mkv file into an animated gif.
- timer.py          ---enter events, and how long they take, and it tells you when to set alarms so that they all end at the same time


Anime Management
================

- get_titles.py             ---reads episode titles from the files in the current directory, and saves them in titles.txt
- link_anime.py             ---creates hardlinks to all the files in the specified directory, while cleaning the filenames
- move_with_dest_names.py   ---moves all contents from one directory to another, keeping the destination names.
- redirect_anime_symlinks   ---a one-use script to quickly redirect links if my anime directory moves. Obselete now that they're all hardlinks
- set_titles.py             ---reads episode titles from titles.txt, and applies them to the files in the current directory


Obscure
=======

- backup                    ---superceded by backup.py
- backup.py                 ---Back up various drives to external HDDs
- progbar                   ---creates a nice progress bar from completion information
- updateImperialCalendar    ---downloads an exchange calendar, converts it and uploads it to Google Calendar. Obsolete


Fun
===

- stripify.py  ---given an mkv file, produces a bmp image of vertical stripes, where the colour of each stripe represents the mean colour at that point in time at the mkv file.

Easter Eggs
===========
The shell is pretty much the least exciting text adventure ever. And what would a text adventure be without easter eggs?

- lose
- repent
- win
- zork
